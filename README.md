# circles-app

Create web application which will allow user to create up to 5 circles with given size and position on the screen. The sum of circles diameters cannot be larger than the viewport width. The application should remember the set of the circles - they should appear again on the screen when the app is reopened. The printed version of the page should have inverted colors (color of the background should become circle color and vice versa).
 
Demonstrate proper structuring of the code, you can use Model-View-* framework of your choice.
